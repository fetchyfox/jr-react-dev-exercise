# React Frontend Coding Exercise
You will be designing a responsive web app that allows a user to put together a food order and then view it in a shopping cart. If you’ve made any online purchases then this flow should be familiar.

## Objective
The purpose of this exercise is to give you an opportunity to demonstrate your design and front end development skills using Javascript, [React.js](https://reactjs.org/), and [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/).

## Time Limits
We don’t enforce a strict time limit but we do consider the time taken to complete a submission. It's used to decide between submissions of equal quality. We also review exercises in the order that they are received, not in the order they were given out.

## Code Requirements
Your project **must** use React and Material UI "mui" components. JSX allows using standard HTML elements but these must be used sparingly. Additional libraries can be used as you see necessary (you may be asked why you chose those libraries).

## Features
This is the minimum required functionality/feature your project must have:

- A way to browse all available items, the “main screen”.

- A way to show item details  as well as any available item customizations when an item is selected from the menu. Not all items will have customization options.

- A way to add items to a shopping cart.

- A "shopping cart" feature showing all added items with their quantities and any customization options.

- A way to switch between the shopping cart and “main screen”

**Pro-Tip**: Functionality will not be a major differentiator so be creative with your interaction and visual designs.

**Pro-Tip #2**: if you want to spend extra time building out your project, then we recommend using that time to improve design aspects rather than implementing new functionality.

## Review
Visual and interaction design will have the largest impact. As long as your submission builds and has the required features listed above we won’t penalize for a lack of functionality.

Code structure, the “design” or your code, will also be judged for maintainability, expandability, and understandability. The majority of energy devoted to a project isn’t with developing it, but with maintaining it.


## Submitting and Testing
Compress your project and email it to [engineering@fetchyfox.com](mailto:engineering@fetchyfox.com) and include your name.

All we're going to do is extract your project and run:
```
npm install
npm start
```

We will be the Chrome developer console to test the app on both mobile and desktop/laptops screen sizes.

## Questions:
Send all questions / comments / concerns to [engineering@fetchyfox.com](mailto:engineering@fetchyfox.com)
